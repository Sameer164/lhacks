## Inspiration
As college students, we are conscious of the lack of bonding happening in our generation. Pairing our lived experiences with statistical data like the rapidly declining marriage rate, inspired us to look to token incentive structure for a possible solution. Rather than blame technology, we chose to embrace it. 



## What it does
Bonded is a next-gen dating application. The applications that are currently in the market are nothing but bots making matching decision.  We bring in human matchmakers that are incentivised to use our application and find matches for the users as they receive our very own token BONDcoin if the match is succesful. Bonded is a community driven, high-stake application that helps solve the problems that single people pace.

## How we built it
Solidity for implementation of bond coin. Remix to compile and deploy the coin. Kivy for both frontend and backend. SQLite to store data the users put into the questionnaire, that helps matchmakers make decision after reading the responses. Web3.py for sending tokens and verifying transactions. We use the ropstein testnet where we deploy the Bond Coin. We connect to the node using infura and our private key and smart contract abi to send or receive tokens. 

## Challenges we ran into

-We had a problem implementing the backend using the concept of blockchain. Learning the concept and implementing it in the code was quite challenging.
- Making our own cryptocurrency using solidity was challenging because we ran into a lot of problems as we were using solidity for the first time and we were unaware about itâ€™s interface and libraries.
-Getting the token for the matchmaker was tough as well which we accomplished using web3.py. 
-Getting test ether took a lot of time as faucets were unresponsive and late.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Bond Coin in our wallets
- Web3.py interacting with ether node
- Proper working frontend that asks for user's information and gives insights to the matchmakers
- Incentivized matchmaking




## What we learned
- We learned that using new technology and learn new concepts was difficult to adopt all while having to create a working deliverable.
- We learned to work on teams and learned the needed frameworks and technologies


## What's next for Bonded
- We think bonded solves a very big problem that people face in the modern dating era.
- We plan to launch it globally and decentralize the dating app industry with the help of blockchain and crypto.
